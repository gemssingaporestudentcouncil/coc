# Code of Conduct

GEMS Singapore Student Council follows the following Code of Conduct.

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of GEMS Singapore Student Council is to be inclusive to the largest number of students, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our events, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in GEMS Singapore Student Council events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Positive Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase positive citizenship by encouraging our event's participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behaviour

The following behaviours are expected and requested of all community members:

 * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
 * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
 * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
 * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
 * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
 * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## 4. Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

 * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
 * Discriminatory jokes and language.
 * Posting or displaying explicit or violent material.
 * "Trolling" and Cyberbullying through digital platforms.
 * Personal insults, particularly those related to a person's identity.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Inappropriate or aggressive physical contact.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention.
 * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

 * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.


## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour from any community member, including external sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behaviour, Student Council members may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from our events without warning.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please notify a nearby teacher or Student Council member as soon as possible.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
